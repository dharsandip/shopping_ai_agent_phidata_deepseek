In this project, an App with AI Agent for shopping recommendations has been built using Streamlit in Python with Phidata, 
FirecrawlTools and deepseek-r1 model (Open Source LLM). After launching the Streamlit App, user needs to specify the product, 
color, specific requirements and also budget. Then, they just need to click on "Recommend" button and our AI agent (created with phidata)
with the help of FirecrawlTools (for web searching and web scrapping) and LLM, will give the shopping recommendations with the top 5 results 
based on the user's needs. It will mention the brand, price, features, e-commerce sites where user can buy etc. in the shopping recommendations.
